GeexEngine
==========

This is a small platform-independent 3D rendering engine.

Please keep in mind that this code currently is under development.
Don't even expect it to compile. Also, only Windows with DirectX 9
is supported by now. WGL-Windows can theoretically be created, but
I doubt the GL code to build at this time.


Current state
-------------

At the current state I'm trying to abstract all necessary 3D objects
that are needed to render something on the screen:
* The rendering device itself with OpenGL or DirectX
* Textures
* Vertex- and Indexbuffers
* Drawing surfaces
* Effects (aka Shaders)

Also, I somehow need a memory management system for all those basic
graphics objects...

The next step is to implement a scene graph togehter with possible
manipulations of objects inside it for animations etc.

After that a small physics engine will be developed which integrates
into the scenegraph.
Originally this was the whole point why I intended to write all this.

You see, there is lots of stuff to do and it will take some time for me
to design and finally implement this in my free time. We'll see if this
project ever gets finished.
